# JPACRUDProject

## Week 8 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

#### Technologies Used
* Java
* JPA
* HTML/JPA
* Git
* Spring Tool Suite

#### Project Description
This project is an example of a full-stack CRUD website. You are able to Create, Read, Update, and Destroy data. Since I am a comic book nerd, the example data in this project is Useless Super Heroes. 

#### How to Run This Program
To use this program you can use the 'Run on Server' option in eclipse. You are brought to the home page, which gives you the option to search for a Super Hero by their ID, list all the Super Heroes, or create a Super Hero.  Each of these options give you extra option once you reach those pages. 

#### Lessons Learned
This project was fun for me to work on. Compared to our group project from last week, this project was a lot easier and much more fun. I enjoyed seeing how an entire website comes together to create something that can work.
